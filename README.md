You've given me purpose to live, not just for me, but for us and our future ahead of us. Waking with a reaosn and making each and eveyday worthwhile. You mean so much to me and I want you feel assure that I am going to be yours forever. If you find yourself, looking for reason to stay, I will say these to you, my love. Our relationship is not ordinary in a good way. Defying all odds of being together will make us stronger than any other relationships. Remember always, that leaving you and unloving you will never be an option for me. You are the best decision | have ever made and I am proud to say you are my better half in front of the people we love and others. I want to let them know that I am now with someone who loves me for me and will always stand by my side holding my hand and never let it go. I vow that I will always be here and I will never leave you. I love you and I will love you more each and everyday, my tangi. Tayo hanggang sa huli.
